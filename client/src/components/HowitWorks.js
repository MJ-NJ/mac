		number: 2,
		title: 'Baseline Calculation and Standardization',
		description:
			'The system includes an automatic baseline calculator, which starts via a command sent through the web application. It collects baseline data for 1 minute and 20 seconds before prompting the patient to breathe into the device. This standardizes testing and ensures consistent data processing.',

		title: 'Breath Sample Collection',
		description:
			'The patient exhales into the device through an air valve for 15 seconds at predefined interval, ensuring consistent timing for accurate model analysis. The valve directs the breath onto the sensor surface for precise readings and is easily removable, sanitizable, and replaceable for hygiene.',

		description:
			'The breath sample is directed ontothe coated Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) sensor, which is treated with porphyrin metal complexes and formulated chemicals. These coatings interact specifically with the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) present in a TB-positive breath sample, producing distinct readings compared to non-TB samples',

		description:
			' If a reading is not produced or is deemed incorrect, an alert is sent to the doctor via the web application, and the patient is asked to provide another breath sample',

			'A vacuum pump introduces fresh air to clear any adsorbed VOCs from the sensor surface, ensuring accurate subsequent readings. This process takes 30 seconds, preventing influence from previous samples. The total time required per patient is about 1 minute and 20 seconds for baseline collection, 1 minute and 20 seconds for the reading, and 30 seconds for sensor cleaning.',
